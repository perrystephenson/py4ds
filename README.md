# Python for Data Science

A work in progress. 

This book will eventually:

* Be a quick reference guide for Python syntax, from the point of view of an R 
  user who wants to start doing data science things in Python as well
* Cover some of the same things as Hadley's 
  [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) book, but for Python
