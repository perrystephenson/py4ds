## Regular Expressions (regex)

Regular Expressions are provided by the **re** package, which is bundled with
most Python distributions.

To use this package, you need to "compile" your regex using the `re.compile()`
function then calling the methods from the returned object.

```{python text1}
# Import the regular expression module
import re

# Compile the pattern: prog
prog = re.compile('\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}')

# See if the pattern matches
result = prog.match('123-456-7890')
print(bool(result))

# See if the pattern matches
result2 = prog.match('1123-456-7890')
print(bool(result2))
```

You can also pass the pattern into `re.match()` directly, but it seems like 
this compilation thing will be useful later on.
