# Pandas

The pandas package was written by Wes McKinney (who seems to be _Hadley
Wickham's_ counterpart for **Python**) and builds on top of the numpy package
to provide DataFrames.

## Creation

To create a DataFrame manually:
  
```{python pandas}
import pandas as pd
dict = {
  "country":    ['Brazil',   'Russia', 'India',     'China',   'South Africa'],
  "capital":    ['Brasilia', 'Moscow', 'New Delhi', 'Beijing', 'Pretoria'    ],
  "area":       [ 8.516,      17.10,    3.286,       9.597,     1.221        ],
  "population": [ 200.4,      143.5,    1252,        1357,      52.98        ]}
df = pd.DataFrame(dict)
df.index      = ['BR',       'RU',     'IN',        'CH',      'SA'          ]
print(df)
```

Alternatively, if you have data in a CSV file you can import it using:
  
```
df = pd.read_csv('<path>')                # If there are no column names
df = pd.read_csv('<path>', index_col = 0) # If there are column names
```

## Subsetting

To select a column in pandas, use `df['country']`. This returns a "pandas
Series" object, which is like a 1D element of a data frame. If you want to get
a data frame back instead of a series, use `df[['country']]`. This is the
opposite of **R**, where the `[[]]` is used to drill down further than `[]`.
The reason for this is that `[]` defines a list in **Python**, so you're really
calling `df[<subset>]` where `<subset>` is a list of length 1. In **R**, the
`[[]]` subset operator is actually a function, hence the differing behaviours.
This means that subsetting for multiple columns in Python doesn't take too much
writing: `df[['country', 'capital']]`.

Interestingly, and perhaps confusingly, if you provide a slice (range) to
`df[]` then you will be subsetting on rows, not columns! Using `df[1:4]`
selects the 2nd through 4th rows of the data frame.

If you want to do anything more complex than this, it starts getting a bit
weird, and you have to use the `loc()` method (which stands for "location"). To
pull out a named row, you need to use the `df.loc['RU']` syntax (which returns
a Series object), or `df.loc[['RU']]` (which returns a DataFrame). You can also
select multiple rows this way: `df.loc[['RU', 'IN', 'CH']]`. You can then
extend this to subset on columns as well, which starts to look a bit more like
**R** (and like the 2D numpy array): `df.loc[['RU', 'IN', 'CH'], ['country',
'capital']]`.

If you want to use an index, then you can do the same thing with lists of
integers passed to the `iloc()` method (which stands for index-location). It
seems like you probably need to chain these functions together if you want to
have a mix of subsetting approaches.

## Reading in chunks

You can use the `chunksize` argument to read a CSV file in chunks, then iterate
over the chunks in a loop. This can be useful when you're dealing with large
amounts of data that won't fit in memory.

```
import pandas as pd
result = []
for chunk in pd.read_csv('data.csv', chunksize = 1000) :
  result.append(sun(chunk['x']))
total = sum(result)
print(total)
```
